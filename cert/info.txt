When generating the certs, these following info were used

CA's countryName = AU, CommonName = example.test
server's countryName = BN, CommonName = server.test, SANS = server.test
client's countryName = IN, CommonName = client.test

// Also I needed to edit /etc/hosts file to add  `127.0.0.1 server.test`

// If we don't use SANS, `certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead` error occurred.
